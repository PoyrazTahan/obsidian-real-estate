We participate in large addressable markets of buying, selling, renting and financing residential real estate in the U.S. As we continue to move towards a transactional model focused on helping customers move, we estimate our TAM has expanded from $19 billion in U.S. residential real estate related advertising in 2019 (according to a Borrell Association report) to nearly $300 billion. Our TAM includes Zillow’s estimate of over $100 billion in referral fees derived from participating in real estate transactions with our partners (based on the 2021 National Association of REALTORS® U.S. Economic Outlook published in November 2021).
